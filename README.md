# docker-deductions-infra-dojo

[Dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo) docker image with tools needed to deploy infrastructure in scope of deductions team.

Tested and released images are published to dockerhub as [nhsdev/deductions-infra-dojo](https://hub.docker.com/r/nhsdev/deductions-infra-dojo)

## Usage
1. Setup docker.
2. Install [Dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo) binary.
3. Provide a Dojofile at the root of the project:
```
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="nhsdev/deductions-infra-dojo:<commit>"
```
4. Create and enter the container by running `dojo` at the root of project.

By default, current directory in docker container is `/dojo/work`.

### Access to AWS

In order to get sufficient access to work with terraform or AWS CLI:

Make sure to unset the AWS variables:
```
unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
unset AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
unset AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
```

The following set-up is based on the README of assume-role [tool](https://github.com/remind101/assume-role)

Setup a profile for each role you would like to assume in `~/.aws/config`.

As an example:

```
[profile default]
region = eu-west-2
output = json

[profile admin]
region = eu-west-2
role_arn = <role-arn>
mfa_serial = <mfa-arn>
source_profile = default
```

Your `source_profile` needs to match your profile in `~/.aws/credentials`.
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <your-aws-access-key-id>
aws_secret_access_key = <your-aws-secret-access-key>
```


#### Assume role with elevated permissions 

##### Install `assume-role` locally
`brew install remind101/formulae/assume-role`

Run the following command with the profile configured in your `~/.aws/config`:
`assume-role admin`

##### Run `assume-role` with dojo
Run the following command with the profile configured in your `~/.aws/config`:
`eval $(dojo "echo <mfa-code> | assume-role admin"`

Run the following command to confirm you assumed the correct role:
`aws sts get-caller-identity` 

Work with terraform as usual:
```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

If your session expires, exit the container to drop the temporary credentials and run `dojo` again.


# Specification

 * base image is alpine, to make this image as small as possible
 * terraform binary on the PATH
 * terraform plugins: aws, null, external, local, template.
 * packer to build MHS images
 * AWS CLI
 * Docker CLI 
 * `jq` to parse JSON from bash scripts
 * `dot` to generate infrastructure graphs from terraform
 * a minimal ssh and git setup - to clone terraform modules

## AWS SSM Parameters Design Principles

When creating the new ssm keys, please follow the agreed convention as per the design specified below:

* all parts of the keys are lower case
* the words are separated by dashes (`kebab case`)
* `env` is optional
  
### Design:
Please follow this design to ensure the ssm keys are easy to maintain and navigate through:

| Type               | Design                                  | Example                                               |
| -------------------| ----------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------|
| **User-specified** |`/repo/<env>?/user-input/`               | `/repo/${var.environment}/user-input/db-username`     |
| **Auto-generated** |`/repo/<env>?/output/<name-of-git-repo>/`| `/repo/output/prm-deductions-base-infra/root-zone-id` |
